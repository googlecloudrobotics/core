# Overview of Cloud Robotics Core

To understand Cloud Robotics Core, you should be familiar with the following concepts:

**Docker containers**
: Containers decouple applications from the environment in which they run. They let you deploy
applications easily and consistently, regardless of whether the target environment is a robot,
an on-premise data center, or the public cloud. Docker is a popular, open-source container format.
Read more about [Containers at Google](https://cloud.google.com/containers/).

**Kubernetes**
: Kubernetes is an open-source system to deploy, scale, and manage containerized applications
anywhere. It lets you deploy containerized applications onto your robots, run them on one or more
compute nodes and manage associated resources like configuration settings or networking. Read
more in the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/).

**Helm**
: Helm is a tool for managing Kubernetes charts. Charts are packages of pre-configured Kubernetes
resources. Read more in the [Helm documentation](https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/master/README.md).

**Custom Resource (CR)**
: Custom resources are extensions of the Kubernetes API that let you manage application-specific
data, offering [many features](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#common-features).
To use a custom resource, you first have to create a Custom Resource Definition (CRD). Read more
about [extending the Kubernetes API with Custom Resource Definitions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-kubernetes-api/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/).

## Layers

Cloud Robotics Core builds upon standard Kubernetes management tools and several open-source
packages. We structure Cloud Robotics Core into several layers that address distinct needs.

![Cloud Robotics Core layers](cloud-robotics-core-layers.png)

### Layer 0: Kubernetes on Robot

Layer 0 is an on-robot Kubernetes setup optimized for single-node clusters. It lets you deploy
containerized workloads onto the robot, run them on one or more compute nodes and manage associated
resources like configuration settings or networking without the overhead of a VM.

You can try it out by following the [Running a ROS node as a Kubernetes deployment](how-to/running-ros-node)
How-to Guide.

### Layer 1: Robot Fleet Connectivity and Security

Layer 1 provides secure communication and access control. Every robot is identified by a unique
keypair. The public key is managed in as Kubernetes configmap.
A cloud-based authorization service uses these keys to authenticate robots and generate short-lived
OAuth access tokens.

This approach follows the [BeyondCorp](https://cloud.google.com/beyondcorp/) zero trust network
model: all connections are authenticated and authorized individually, without a need for a
traditional VPN. A specific robot's access may be revoked if needed. The same set of credentials
also serves as foundation for Apps to securely communicate with the cloud over gRPC.

You can try it out by following the [Connecting a robot to the cloud](how-to/connecting-robot)
How-to Guide.

Layer 1 also provides a light-weight cluster federation system that synchronizes selected custom
resources accross the fleet. This provides developers with a pattern for command & control that is
robust against intermittent conenctivity and fits well with the overall declarative Kubernetes
model. You can read more in the concept guide about [Federation](concepts/federation.md).

> **Note:** Layer 2 and 3 (below) are currently under development. You'll find an early
> implementation of these layers in our repository but corresponding APIs and concepts are not stable yet.

### Layer 2: App Management

Layer 2 introduces App management, built as a lightweight facade on top of Kubernetes and the Helm
package manager. In Cloud Robotics Core, Apps consist of one or more Docker containers and
associated resources, that run on the robot and in the cloud. The App management layer determines
which Apps, and app components, run on robots and in the cloud. The concept guide has more details
on [Application Management](concepts/app-management.md).

### Layer 3: Managed Repositories

Layer 3 adds the capability to download Apps from remote repositories. Most of our core platform
services will be packaged as optional downloadable extensions via a Google-managed repository. In
addition, vendor-managed repositories can be added and used for locating new or updated vendor-
provided Apps.

Apps provide DevOps and robotics services such as:

* Logs aggregation and stack traces with StackDriver
* Metric collection, upload and dashboarding with Prometheus and Grafana
* Sensor data transport for cloud-based analysis
* Remote debugging using RViz over WebRTC
* Remote administration
